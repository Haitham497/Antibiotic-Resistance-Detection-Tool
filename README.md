# Antibiotic-Resistance-Detection-Tool
This tool detects antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogenicity islands (PAIs) in bacterial genome sequences. It uses sequence alignment against curated databases to identify ARGs and analyzes genomic features such as mobility genes and tRNA sites to predict PAIs.
